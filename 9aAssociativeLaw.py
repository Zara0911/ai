'''Associative law, in mathematics, either of two laws relating to number operations of addition
and multiplication, stated symbolically: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c, and a(bc) = (ab)c; that is, the
terms or factors may be associated in any way desired. While associativity holds for ordinary
arithmetic with real or imaginary numbers, there are certain applications—such as non
associative algebras—in which it does not hold.'''
